what is a network?
    2 computers connected through a wire(cat 5 cable ) the connctor is called as RJ45 that is plugged into the port.

LAN - Local area Network

    In a small area or office, several computers are connected through a networking device using - SWITCH or HUB using each computers IP address.

WAN - wide area Network

    For eg: company is at 2 locations , salem and chennai.
        The computer in the company have to be connected in both the locations
        ISP - Here comes the ISP (Internet service provider) locally they provide the connection between salem and chennai.
            ISP - have high data speed connections to provide service for the WAN fro companies.
        Jack on the bulding in salem to ISP at salem then to ISP at chennai to Jack at chennai.

Internet are very massive WAN (wan connected to wan to wan ....)where information and communcations are shared using standardised protocols.   
    - if the distance between the 2 systems is long there might be a delay in network.
bit and Byte
    1 Byte = 8 bit

    bit is 0 or 1
    Byte 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 - (8 digit sequence of bits i.e. 0's and 1's)

    Speed is always calculated by bits and data is always calculated by Bytes.
        Speed - 1 Mbps (mega bit per second)
        Data - 128 KB file ( Kilo Byte) - 128 KB * 8 = 1024 bits of data i.e. 1 Mbps speed.     
            so at 1 Mbps speed, 128 kb data can be transferred in a second.

Network Topology
    Star Topology
    Ring Topology
    Bus Topology.

    Star Topology
        like in a star, all the systems are connected to a central switch.

IP - Internet protocols: (4 octets separated by decimals)

    IP's are classified into 5 protocols,

    Class A - 1 to 126 (first octet shoulb be in the range)
    Class B - 128 to 191 
    class C - 192 to 223
    Class D - 224 to 239 - multicast
    Class E - 240 to 255 - reserved for experimenttal purposes
    127 is used for loop back address.

    subnet for class A is 255.0.0.0 - 8 ones / 24 zeros(24 subnet masks) ( 2^24 - 2 is the total number of hosts)
    Subnet for class B is 255.255.0.0 - 16 ones / 16 zeros ( 2^16 - 2 is the total number of hosts)
    Subnet for class C is 255.255.255.0 - 24 ones / 8 zeros ( 2^8 - 2 is the total number of hosts)

    Cisco recommends the number of hosts should be limited within 500

    Netwrok for each class ends where the subnet is 255 or the Ones ends, in the above example.

    Gateway and IP should be on the same Network.

        Gateway is used when a network wants to connect to other network. as the name it is the gateway to pass through.

    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 - total 255.

    each one is called as place holder from 1 to 8 , startting left to right for subnetting.

    Subnetting :

        Borrowing the Zeros and adding as 1's that forms the new network with the below ID'salem    

            Network ID :
            Broadcast ID : 

Internet Connecting devices :

    Hubs :
        Hubs are non interlligent devices.
        Hubs can collide with only one network, the other network if joines will corrupt everything.
        Hubs are one Broadcast, they just Broadcast it to all ports and couldn't restrict to one.
        one broadcast domain. - if  a broadcast traffic is received , it forwards it to other ports.

    Bridge : Just an upgrade to hubs and not used anywhere practically.

    Switches :
        Switch works mainly with Layer 2 information.
        A switch - learns/Save all the mac id of the systems connected to it within 10 secs powered on.
        Switches are intelligent devices.
        Uses the Mac ID(Layer 2 addresss) and IP address(Layer 3 address) to connect to the near by devices on SAME NETWORK.
        12 or 24 ports - Each port is connected to same network.
        Cisco switches do not have a power button, only router has a  power button.
        It is many collison, as the number of ports.
        one broadcast domain. - if  a broadcast traffic is received , it forwards it to other ports.


    Routers :
        Routers are mainly intelligent devices.
        A router connectcs devices from one network to other network.
        A router can limit the broadcast to a particular port.
        A router usually has a routig table that consists of IP's of all other routers in the same network.
        ARP - ARP request is sent to get the MAC address.
        A router strips down the layer2 information and works with the layer 3 information.

DHCP : Dynamic Host configuration protocol

    The first 4 are very critical DHCP - Discovery, Offer, Request, ACK.

    DHCP discovery :
        Asking for avaliable IP of DHCP servers in the same network.
    
    DHCP Offer :
        The avaliable DHCP servers offers the avaliable reserved IP's to DHCP discovery.

    DHCP request :
        The DHCP discovery requests to take one of the given IP's to the DHCP Server.

    DHCP ACK :
        The DHCP server acknowledges (ACK) that, good you can take the IP.
    
    DHCP information :
        DHCP requests when it is neede to obtain more information from DHCP server 

    DHCP release:
        Used to release the DHCP IP

TCP : it is a connection oriented transmision where both the machines are aware of the communication at the beggining itself.
    It fisrts build the connecttion and then starts the transmission.

    3 way handshaking 
    Windowing
        
         3 way handshaking :
            A send the SYN request to B through the network.
            B acknowledges and says am ready and send backs SYN + ACK to A through the network.
            A finally acknowledges it with sending an ACK to B through the network.

        Windowing :
            Transmission of big files .
                A send 10 files to B. B asks for file 11 after acknowledging the request.
                A sends 10-100 files to B. B asks for file 101 asks for file 11 after acknowledging the request.
                As the number of Packets increases, it will reach a point where 1000 is send and B says am waiting for 901.
                    it means only it can accept 900, not the entire 1000. So capacity is established.
                The capacity of the device cannot be established earliers,Since different devices have different transmission capacity.
